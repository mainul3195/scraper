# üß† Meeting Video Scraper

This repository provides a robust, modular system for scraping and downloading public meeting videos from a variety of platforms. It is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to use for both metadata collection and high-speed video downloads.

---

## üì¶ Features
- **Problem 1:** Scrape meeting metadata (title, date, link, etc.) from public video directories over a date range.
- **Problem 2:** Extract direct, downloadable video URLs from meeting pages, verifying with `yt-dlp`.
- **Bonus:** Download videos at high speed using `yt-dlp` with `aria2c` as an external downloader.
- Modular, reusable code ready for scale.
- Outputs clean, structured JSON for easy database ingestion.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/)
- [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) (`pip install playwright`)
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (if used in Problem 1)
- Run `playwright install` after installing the package.

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install yt-dlp playwright requests
playwright install
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem 1: Scraping Meeting Metadata
- **Script:** `problem1.py`
- **Input:** JSON with `start_date`, `end_date`, and `base_urls` (see `input.json`).
- **Output:** Structured JSON with all matching meeting metadata (see `output.json`).

**Supported scrapers:**
- [Detroit Cablecast PublicSite](http://detroit-vod.cablecast.tv/CablecastPublicSite) (**fully implemented**)
- [Lansdale CivicMedia](https://www.lansdale.org/CivicMedia?CID=2024-Council-Meetings-26) (**fully implemented**)
- [YouTube Live Meetings](https://www.youtube.com/@SLCLiveMeetings/streams) (**fully implemented**)
- [Regional Web TV](https://www.regionalwebtv.com/fredcc) (**fully implemented**)
- [Facebook Videos](https://www.facebook.com/DauphinCountyPA/videos) (**partially implemented, see below**)
- [Charleston CivicClerk](https://charlestonwv.portal.civicclerk.com/) [Winchester CivicWeb](https://winchesterva.civicweb.net/portal/) (**PDF, not yet implemented**)

**Facebook Scraper Note:**
> The Facebook video scraper is not yet fully reliable due to issues with infinite scrolling and dynamic content loading. It attempts aggressive scrolling and extraction, but may miss videos or require further work to handle Facebook's anti-bot measures and page structure changes.

**PDF Scrapers:**
> The Charleston CivicClerk scraper and the Winchester CivicWeb PDF scraper is not yet implemented.

**Input Example:**
```json
{
    "start_date": "2025-05-25",
    "end_date": "2025-06-01",
    "base_urls": [
        "https://www.youtube.com/@SLCLiveMeetings/streams"
    ]
}
```

**Output Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@SLCLiveMeetings/streams",
    "medias": [
      {
        "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tesHDQKXv_s",
        "title": "Salt Lake City Council Work Session - 05/29/2025",
        "date": "2025-05-30",
        "source_type": "video"
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpjwumLsejM",
        "title": "Planning Commission Meeting -- 05/28/2025",
        "date": "2025-05-29",
        "source_type": "video"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Run:**
```bash
python problem1.py
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem 2: Video Download URL Resolution
- **Script:** `problem2.py`
- **Input:** List of meeting URLs (from Problem 1 output).
- **Output:** List of direct video URLs that are downloadable with `yt-dlp`.

**How it works:**
- Visits each meeting page using Playwright.
- Extracts direct video sources (from HTML, iframes, and network requests).
- Verifies each candidate URL with `yt-dlp --simulate`.
- Outputs only valid, downloadable video URLs.
- Handles special cases for highly protected or embedded streams.

**Run:**
```bash
python problem2.py
```
- Edit the list of URLs in the script as needed.

---

### üí° Bonus: Faster Downloads with aria2c
- **Script:** `bonus.py`
- **Input:** List of direct video URLs (from Problem 2 output).
- **Output:** Downloads videos at high speed using `yt-dlp` + `aria2c`.

**How it works:**
- Uses the `yt-dlp` Python API with `aria2c` as the external downloader.
- Configures `aria2c` for multi-threaded, split, and robust retry downloads.
- Falls back to standard yt-dlp if aria2c is not available.

**Run:**
```bash
python bonus.py
```
- Edit the list of URLs in the script as needed.

### üß© Special/Tricky Tasks

#### tricky_task_1.py
- **Problem:** Some sites (e.g., IBM Video) provide audio and video streams separately.
- **Solution:**
  - Use `yt-dlp --list-formats` to find the best video-only and audio-only formats.
  - Download them separately:
    ```bash
    yt-dlp -f <video_format_id> -o video_only.mp4 <url>
    yt-dlp -f <audio_format_id> -o audio_only.mp4 <url>
    ```
  - Merge them using ffmpeg:
    ```bash
    ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -i audio_only.mp4 -c copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 final_output.mp4
    ```
- See the script for an automated example.

#### tricky_task_2.py
- **Problem:** Some sites require custom headers and cookies to download m3u8 streams (high security).
- **Solution:**
  - Use Playwright to capture the m3u8 URL and all request headers/cookies.
  - Build a `yt-dlp` command with `--add-header` for each required header.
  - Example output from the script:
    ```bash
    yt-dlp --add-header "cookie: ..." --add-header "user-agent: ..." --add-header "referer: ..." "<m3u8_url>"
    ```
- See the script for a working example.

## üîó Full Pipeline Example
1. **Scrape metadata:**
    - `python problem1.py`
2. **Extract direct video URLs:**
    - Copy URLs from `output.json` to the input for `problem2.py`.
    - `python problem2.py`
3. **Download videos at high speed:**
    - Copy URLs from the output of `problem2.py` to the input for `bonus.py`.
    - `python bonus.py`

---

## üß© Modularity & Scaling
- Each task is a standalone script, but functions can be imported and reused.
- Output is always clean, structured JSON for easy database ingestion.
- Designed to be robust against edge cases and varied website structures.

---

## üìù Notes
- For best results, always use the latest version of `yt-dlp` and `aria2c`.
- Some sites may require additional handling (e.g., login, cookies, or advanced scraping logic).
- **Facebook video extraction is not yet fully reliable due to scrolling/dynamic loading issues.**
- **PDF scraping is only implemented for Charleston CivicClerk; Winchester CivicWeb is not yet implemented.**
- You can further automate the pipeline by combining the scripts or using a workflow manager.

## üèÖ Bonus Task: Speed Comparison
- Try downloading a large video with and without `aria2c` to see the speed difference!
- Example command for manual test:
  ```bash
  yt-dlp --external-downloader aria2c --external-downloader-args "-x 16 -k 1M" <video_url>
  ```
