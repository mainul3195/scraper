# üß† Meeting Video Scraper

This repository provides a robust, modular system for scraping and downloading public meeting videos from a variety of platforms. It is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to use for both metadata collection and high-speed video downloads.

---

## üì¶ Features
- **Problem 1:** Scrape meeting metadata (title, date, link, etc.) from public video directories over a date range.
- **Problem 2:** Extract direct, downloadable video URLs from meeting pages, verifying with `yt-dlp`.
- **Bonus:** Download videos at high speed using `yt-dlp` with `aria2c` as an external downloader.
- **Tricky Tasks Included:**
  - Audio/video stream merging (e.g., IBM Video)
  - Downloading m3u8 streams with custom headers/cookies (high-security sites)
- Modular, reusable code ready for scale.
- Outputs clean, structured JSON for easy database ingestion.

### üè∑Ô∏è Scraper Class Descriptions

Below are short descriptions of each scraper class implemented in `scrapers.py`:

- **DetroitScraper**
  > Scrapes meeting videos from Detroit's Cablecast PublicSite. Navigates paginated video galleries, extracts video titles, URLs, and meeting dates, and filters results by a specified date range. Uses Playwright for browser automation.

- **LansdaleScraper**
  > Scrapes meeting videos from Lansdale's CivicMedia portal. Iterates through paginated video listings, collects video URLs and titles, and visits each video page to extract upload dates. Filters videos by date range. Uses Playwright for navigation and extraction.

- **FacebookVideoScraper**
  > Scrapes all video links and titles from a public Facebook video page. Aggressively scrolls and loads content to collect up to 100 videos. Note: Cannot extract upload dates, so date filtering is not supported. Uses Playwright for browser automation.

- **CharlestonCivicClerkScraper**
  > Scrapes published PDF files (such as agendas, packets, and minutes) from Charleston's CivicClerk portal via its public API. Iterates through paginated event data, collects file links, and filters by event date. Uses aiohttp for API requests.

- **YouTubeLiveMeetingsScraper**
  > Scrapes live meeting videos from a YouTube channel's streams page. Scrolls to load all video items, extracts video URLs and titles, and visits each video page to extract upload dates. Filters videos by date range. Uses Playwright for browser automation.

- **RegionalWebTVScraper**
  > Scrapes meeting videos from Regional Web TV. Detects and processes embedded iframes containing video listings, extracts video URLs, titles, and dates (parsed from titles), and filters by date range. Uses Playwright for navigation and extraction.

- **WinchesterVAScraper**
  > Scrapes both meeting documents (PDFs) and videos from Winchester's CivicWeb portal. Fetches meeting lists via API, then uses Selenium to extract agenda and video links from meeting detail pages. Filters results by date range. Uses requests and Selenium for scraping.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem 2: Video Download URL Resolution
- **Script:** `problem2.py`
- **Input:** List of meeting URLs (from Problem 1 output).
- **Output:** List of direct video URLs that are downloadable with `yt-dlp`.

**How it works:**
- Visits each meeting page using Playwright.
- Extracts direct video sources (from HTML, iframes, and network requests).
- Verifies each candidate URL with `yt-dlp --simulate`.
- Outputs only valid, downloadable video URLs.
- Handles special cases for highly protected or embedded streams.

**Run:**
```bash
python problem2.py
```
- Edit the list of URLs in the script as needed.

---

### üí° Bonus: Faster Downloads with aria2c
- **Script:** `bonus.py`
- **Input:** List of direct video URLs (from Problem 2 output).
- **Output:** Downloads videos at high speed using `yt-dlp` + `aria2c`.

**How it works:**
- Uses the `yt-dlp` Python API with `aria2c` as the external downloader.
- Configures `aria2c` for multi-threaded, split, and robust retry downloads.
- Falls back to standard yt-dlp if aria2c is not available.

**Run:**
```bash
python bonus.py
```
- Edit the list of URLs in the script as needed.

---

### üß© Special/Tricky Tasks

#### tricky_task_1.py
- **Problem:** Some sites (e.g., IBM Video) provide audio and video streams separately.
- **Solution:**
  - Use `yt-dlp --list-formats` to find the best video-only and audio-only formats.
  - Download them separately:
    ```bash
    yt-dlp -f <video_format_id> -o video_only.mp4 <url>
    yt-dlp -f <audio_format_id> -o audio_only.mp4 <url>
    ```
  - Merge them using ffmpeg:
    ```bash
    ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -i audio_only.mp4 -c copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 final_output.mp4
    ```
- See the script for an automated example.

#### tricky_task_2.py
- **Problem:** Some sites require custom headers and cookies to download m3u8 streams (high security).
- **Solution:**
  - Use Playwright to capture the m3u8 URL and all request headers/cookies.
  - Build a `yt-dlp` command with `--add-header` for each required header.
  - Example output from the script:
    ```bash
    yt-dlp --add-header "cookie: ..." --add-header "user-agent: ..." --add-header "referer: ..." "<m3u8_url>"
    ```
- See the script for a working example.

## üîó Full Pipeline Example
1. **Scrape metadata:**
    - `python problem1.py`
2. **Extract direct video URLs:**
    - Copy URLs from `output.json` to the input for `problem2.py`.
    - `python problem2.py`
3. **Download videos at high speed:**
    - Copy URLs from the output of `problem2.py` to the input for `bonus.py`.
    - `python bonus.py`

---

## üß© Modularity & Scaling
- Each task is a standalone script, but functions can be imported and reused.
- Output is always clean, structured JSON for easy database ingestion.
- Designed to be robust against edge cases and varied website structures.

---

## üìù Notes
- For best results, always use the latest version of `yt-dlp` and `aria2c`.
- Some sites may require additional handling (e.g., login, cookies, or advanced scraping logic).
- **Facebook video extraction can collect all video links and titles, but cannot extract upload dates, so filtering by date is not supported.**
- **All 6 classes for test data in problem1.py are implemented and working, except for Facebook date extraction.**
- **Both tricky tasks are also accomplished successfully.**
- You can further automate the pipeline by combining the scripts or using a workflow manager.

## üèÖ Bonus Task: Speed Comparison
- Try downloading a large video with and without `aria2c` to see the speed difference!
- Example command for manual test:
  ```bash
  yt-dlp --external-downloader aria2c --external-downloader-args "-x 16 -k 1M" <video_url>
  ```
